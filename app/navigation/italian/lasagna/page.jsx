          Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. It is a hearty and comforting meal that has been enjoyed for centuries. The dish is believed to have originated in Ancient Greece, but it was the Italians who perfected it and made it their own.

        <p style={descriptionStyle}>
          Traditional lasagna is made with a rich meat sauce, often containing ground beef or pork, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. The sauce is layered between sheets of pasta and a creamy b√©chamel sauce, then topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The dish is baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the pasta is tender.
